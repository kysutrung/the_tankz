# THE TANKZ - Smart Aquarium Controller using Arduino

## Introduction

This project is a smart aquarium controller that automates water temperature monitoring, feeding, heating and filtration. Using an Arduino microcontroller, water temperature sensors and relays, this system ensures optimal conditions for aquatic life while reducing manual maintenance.

## Features

- **Automatic Feeding**: Scheduled feeding mechanism to dispense food at set intervals.
- **Temperature Control**: Monitors water temperature and activates the heater if needed.
- **Water Filtration**: Controls a water pump to maintain clean water.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays current temperature and system status on an LCD screen.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino (Uno, Mega, or Nano)
- DS18B20 Waterproof Temperature Sensor
- Relay Module (for heater, filter, and feeder control)
- Servo Motor (for automatic feeder)
- LCD Display (16x2 with I2C module)

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure proper wiring of relays and sensors.
- Verify power supply requirements for all components.
